h1. Chicken Scheme Examples

  "Official Chicken Scheme Site":http://call-cc.org/
  "Chicken Libraries (eggs)":http://wiki.call-cc.org/chicken-projects/egg-index-4.html

h2. Examples I want

* Mechanize like http client example code, show use of auth, cookies and ssl
* processing yaml, probably via C library libyaml, see: http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML (exists in homebrew and apt)
* interacting with a database, eg: postgres and mysql
* easyweb: spiffy has no routing table to map routes to handlers as with projects like Rails, the more automagical the better.  Also: show cookie support
