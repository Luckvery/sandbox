h1. Continuations

What to prototype?

Look at Impresario.  This is the MVC style, logic turned inside out.  Wiring or
connections of states is mostly externalized - not an easy to see core flow.

Continuations can be used to Re-Invert the IOC.  Could they work as an alternative
to a state machine?  

  * how do you serialize the continuation states to save the workflow
  * do you need to?  or can you just escape w/the state information?
