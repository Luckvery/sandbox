h1. Example of Calling Clojure from JRuby

To run the full example you will need the following dependencies:

* clojure.jar:         http://code.google.com/p/clojure/downloads/list 
* clojure-contrib.jar: http://code.google.com/p/clojure-contrib/downloads/list
* clj-xpath-1.0.6.jar
* xalan-2.7.1.jar

If you don't want to bother with the clj-xpath example, just eliminiate those parts of the test.rb file and the earlier code should execute just fine.   The clj-xpath test code is there to demonstrate how to call clojure functions that have characters which are illegal in Ruby symbol names.
