h1. Nanite Examples

These examples make use of the "Nanite":http://github.com/ezmobius/nanite messaging and job processing framework.

h2. Overview

Nanite uses the "RabbitMQ":http://www.rabbitmq.com/ AMQP messaging broker to distribute messages from a central @Mapper@ to @Agent@s (workers).  The mapper listens to the broker for agents registring themselves for work to be done.  When a mapper has a job to be submitted, it will sent it to what it beleives is the least busy worker and optionally wait for a reply.

The first example @./simple-service@ implements the basic model where a mapper hands jobs out to agents advertisting the @/example/additiou@ service.
