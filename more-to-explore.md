# Overview

This is a log of some of the ideas I want to learn more about or explore.

## Rand-a-minder

Web site/service that allows you to configure random reminders.  Random both over a time interval, and random from a set of messages.

## Building an Ensemble Fuzzy String Matching Algorithim with Genetic Programming

Needs a better tagline, but the idea is an extension of thoughts I had at Barcamp Philly in Nov 2009.

1. Create a training set of data
  1. Person Names
  2. Address Data
  3. Organization Names
2. The chromosome is a chaining and weighting of the matchers
  1. a matcher returns true/false
  2. the chromosme returns true/false

## Examples

* Remind Me to Buy Flowers for my wife
  * Interval: M-F, 9am-5pm
  * Frequency: once every other week
  * Duration: forever
  * Message: Pick up flowers on the way home.  Lillys are her favorite.

* Reminde Me to call my Brother/Sister
  * Interval: Weekends, 10am-8pm
  * Frequency: Every Weekend
  * Duration: forever
  * Message: Your sibling would like to hear from you!

* Remind Me to buy a present for my cousin
  * Interval: October through November 7th (bday on 11th)
  * Frequency: About twice a week
  * Duration: till I reply 'done' or cancel
  * Message: Little Susy/Johnny would love to get a gift for their birthday.

Web based, allow reminding via IM (aim, gtalk), allow reminding via email, allow reminding via twitter (DM only).
