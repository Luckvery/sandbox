h1. Ubuntu and Unity 12.04 and 12.10

Sorry, no.

Inside VirtualBox it is just too slow, the Alt-Tab behavior is different that my
twitch reflexes can't adapt to it.  The Unity taskbar just seems to be in my way.

"Openbox":http://openbox.org/ is an alternative I'm exploring.

"Openbox: Bindings":http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Bindings

This directory contains my OpenBox configuration.  It can be installed by typing 'rake', which will also call @openbox --reconfigure'.

h2. The setup I like

h3. Desktops

I like having 10 desktops.

* 1 is for local administration
* 2 is where I run a browser and do front-end web development
* 3 is where I do my main coding

At $WORK, I like following a convention of assigning a project to a particular
desktop.  That way I always know where things are.

h3. Mouse Focus

I love focus follows mouse.  I like being able to have a smaller terminal
'float' on top of a larger one, and be typing and interacting with the lower
one.

I love being able to hold down Alt and drag windows around from any pixel
inside the window.

h3. Keybindings

* C-F12 open a new terminal
* A-Home toggle maximization
* A-Right toggle maximization horizontal
* A-Up toggle maximization vertical
* A-1 go to desktop 1
* A-2 go to desktop 2
* A-3 go to desktop 3
* A-4 go to desktop 4
* A-5 go to desktop 5
* A-6 go to desktop 6
* A-7 go to desktop 7
* A-8 go to desktop 8
* A-9 go to desktop 9
* A-10 go to desktop 10
