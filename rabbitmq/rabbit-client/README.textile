h1. Rabbit Client Library

h3. Goals

The goals I had in mind when I created this were to use AMQP for relaible
message delivery.  The defualt settings reflect that choice.

The library uses the rabbitmq-java-client library version 2.5.0, and uses AMPP
0.9 by default.

The library is designed around an array of brokers, where a publish will
attempt to publish to all of the brokers in the array.

If a message can not be published to at least N brokers (where N is declared in
the publisher configuration) an exception is thrown allowing callers of the
client to know that the message could not be reliably delivered.

If a broker can not be contacted during a publish it will be passed over.  The
library uses a circuit breaker around the broker connections and will attempt
to re-establish a connection during some subsequent publish.

The publisher includes the ability to retry a publish.  If an error is
encountered during the publish, and at least N brokers were not published to,
the client library will immediately retry, attempting to re-connect to the
brokers.

If the client library reaches this condition, backpressure will be put on the
code calling this library based on the time it takes to attempt the broker
connections.

... 
Use a background process to re-establish broken connections?  That way
publish's stay fast, and reconnects still happen ?
